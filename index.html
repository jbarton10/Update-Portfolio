                                <p>This is me Hello! My name is Jamie Barton.
                                        I am 22 years old and have always had a passion for different technologies!
                                         Ever sense I was young I have loved playing video games and messing around on computers.
                                          This lead me down a path to begin coding and wanting to understand how computers work.
                                       I was born and raised in Tucson Arizona, and I went to Catilina Foothills High School.
                                        I went to NAU for two years out of high school but ended up moving back because I missed Tucson. 
                                        While I was at NUA I began studying Electrical Engineering, but decided after my first semester that I did not like hardware aspect.
                                         After this I found Computer Science! I struggled for a while with programming at first but began to like it more after I got some experience under my belt!
                                          After moving back to Tucson I went to Pima for a year and then moved to U of A for a year!
                                       
                                       I enjoy hanging out with my friends, playing piano, and playing chess! 
                                       I also like to go outside when it's not too hot and slackline! I have 3 cats and a dog, that I love very much.
                                        All of my imediate family lives in Tucson as well. My brother is a web designer, my Mom is a Pilates teacher and my Dad teaches geo-chemistry at U of A.
